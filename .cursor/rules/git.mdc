# Git Rules

## Commit Messages

### Basic Guidelines

- For commit messages, keep them super short and concise. Just a couple of sentences max.
- Use only ASCII characters in commit messages (no emojis, Japanese, etc.)
- Write commit messages in English for international collaboration

### Format Guidelines

- **Subject line**: Keep it around 50 characters, capitalize the first letter, no period at the end
- **Use imperative mood**: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug"
- **Add details if needed**: Leave a blank line after the subject, then add explanation wrapped at 72 characters
- **Focus on why**: Explain what the problem was and why this change fixes it

### Examples

```
Fix API endpoint validation

This commit addresses several validation issues:

- Add null check for request body
- Validate required fields before processing
- Return proper error codes for invalid input

Fixes #123
```

## Pull Requests

- Write titles and descriptions in English for international collaboration
- When creating PRs with GitHub CLI that have long descriptions, ALWAYS create a temporary file for the description instead of passing it directly as command line arguments. Use `gh pr create --body-file temp_file.md` to avoid zsh misinterpreting special characters
